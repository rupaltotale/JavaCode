	// Question 1
	// Write a Java method to count all vowels in a string. Hint: Use substring()
	// for this challenge question. You can also use charAt().
	//
	//
	// Question 2
	// Write a Java method to count all words in a string entered by a user. Assume
	// that each word is separated by a SINGLE SPACE and that there is at least 1
	// word in the string.
	// Example: "This is a big world" has 4 words
	//
	//
	// Question 3
	// Write a Java method to check whether a string entered by a user is a valid
	// password.
	// Password rules:
	// A password must have at least ten characters.
	// A password must have at least one uppercase letter.
	// A password must contain at least two digits.
	// Note: Password MUST meet all 3 rules to be considered valid.
	//
	//
	// Question 4
	// Given an integer n, perform the following conditional actions:
	// If n is odd, print "red"
	// If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 print "blue" (2,3,4,5)
	// If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 print "green" (6,7,8, 9,
	// 10....20)
	// If n is even and greater than 20 print "yellow"
	//
	//
	// Question 5
	// Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays (int
	// values)
	// and print the similar elements to the console. Assume that both arrays have
	// the same length (equal number of int elements)
	// For example, for:
	// int[] array1 = {2, 3, 4};
	// int[] array2 = {3, 6,7};
	// 3 is printed out to the console
